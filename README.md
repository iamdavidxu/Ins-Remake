# Instagram UI Recreate

This repository showcases a project that recreates the home page of the web version of Instagram. The main goal of this project was to reference Instagram's user interface and create a responsive home page design that closely resembles the original platform.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** The recreated Instagram home page is designed to be responsive mainly using Flexbox, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes. The design modifies the distribution of different sections accordingly. The user could also upload posts of different dimensions which wouldn't affect the presentation of contents.
  
- **Enhanced User Experience:** One of the key enhancements made to the UI was adding a scroll bar to the dashboard section, particularly for smaller screens that have limited access to other pages. This improvement significantly improves user experience by enabling smooth navigation and access to content.

- **Efficient Programming Techniques:** The web page was developed using efficient programming techniques, such as optimizing code structure, minimizing redundancy, and using best practices in HTML and CSS, allowing for a tailored approach to meet specific design and functionality requirements.

## How to Use
